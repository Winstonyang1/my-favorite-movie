<p><Summary></Summary></p>

<h2>Danny Ocean (Clooney) has been out of prison for less than a day and is already walking around with a great plan. 
He wants to rob three major Casinos in one evening, all owned by Terrence Benedict (Garcia), the current boyfriend of his ex-wife (Roberts). 
To do that job, he puts together a team, Danny Ocean's eleven men. They prepare the job step by step, of course with the necessary comical incidents, setbacks and sidesteps. 
The fact that you only get a limited idea of ​​how they will go about it means that you will still be faced with quite a few surprises when they ultimately implement the plan.
